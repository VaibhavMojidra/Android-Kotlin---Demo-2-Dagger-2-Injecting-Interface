# Android Kotlin Demo 2 Dagger 2 Interface Injection

Dagger 2 is a popular dependency injection framework for Java and Android development. It provides a way to manage and inject dependencies in your application using compile-time generated code.

In Dagger 2, interface injection refers to the process of injecting dependencies into an interface rather than a concrete class. While interface injection is not the primary approach in Dagger 2 (constructor or field injection is typically used), it can be achieved with the help of the @Binds annotation.
